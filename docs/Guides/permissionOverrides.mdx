Permission overrides allow you to allow or deny a specific role the ability to use a command, regardless of group permissions.

## Creating a permission override

To create a permission override, you use the `permission-override` command.

Use the `permission-override add` sub-command, and the prompts will guide you.

<DiscordMessages>
	<DiscordMessage>.po add</DiscordMessage>
	<DiscordMessage profile="RoManager">
		<DiscordEmbed embedTitle="Prompt" slot="embeds" color="#3498db">
			<DiscordEmbedDescription slot="description">
				What role would you like to override?
			</DiscordEmbedDescription>
			<DiscordEmbedFooter slot="footer">
				This prompt will expire in 300 seconds. Say "cancel" to cancel.
			</DiscordEmbedFooter>
		</DiscordEmbed>
	</DiscordMessage>
	<DiscordMessage>
		<DiscordMention>Promote Permissions</DiscordMention>
	</DiscordMessage>
	<DiscordMessage profile="RoManager">
		<DiscordEmbed embedTitle="Prompt" slot="embeds" color="#3498db">
			<DiscordEmbedDescription slot="description">
				What command would you like to add an override for?
			</DiscordEmbedDescription>
			<DiscordEmbedFooter slot="footer">
				This prompt will expire in 300 seconds. Say "cancel" to cancel.
			</DiscordEmbedFooter>
		</DiscordEmbed>
	</DiscordMessage>
	<DiscordMessage>role</DiscordMessage>
	<DiscordMessage profile="RoManager">
		<DiscordEmbed embedTitle="Prompt" slot="embeds" color="#3498db">
			<DiscordEmbedDescription slot="description">
				Allow or deny usage of the command? (allow/deny)
			</DiscordEmbedDescription>
			<DiscordEmbedFooter slot="footer">
				This prompt will expire in 300 seconds. Say "cancel" to cancel.
			</DiscordEmbedFooter>
		</DiscordEmbed>
	</DiscordMessage>
	<DiscordMessage>allow</DiscordMessage>
	<DiscordMessage profile="RoManager">
		Added <b>role</b> command override for <b>Promote Permissions</b> (
		<b>allow</b>)
	</DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>
<br />

:::tip

- Don't want to ping the role you're changing an override for? Just use the role's name.

- Don't want to type `permission-override` every time? Just type in `po`.

- Instead of having to follow the prompts, you can put it in one message if you put the arguments in the same order.

## Viewing permission overrides

Use the `permission-override view` sub-command, and RoManager will display all permission overrides.

<DiscordMessages>
	<DiscordMessage>.po view</DiscordMessage>
	<DiscordMessage profile="RoManager">
		<DiscordEmbed
			embedTitle="Group Permission Overrides"
			slot="embeds"
			color="#3498db"
		>
			<DiscordEmbedFields slot="fields">
				<DiscordEmbedField fieldTitle="Allow">
					<b>role</b>: <DiscordMention>Promote Permissions</DiscordMention>
				</DiscordEmbedField>
				<DiscordEmbedField fieldTitle="Deny">None</DiscordEmbedField>
			</DiscordEmbedFields>
		</DiscordEmbed>
	</DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

## Removing permission overrides

Use the `permission-override remove` sub-command and follow the prompts.

<DiscordMessages>
