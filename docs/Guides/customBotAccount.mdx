The custom bot account feature allows you to use your own account instead of the RoManager accounts.

import {
	DiscordMessages,
	DiscordMessage,
	DiscordMention,
} from "@skyra/discord-components-react";

:::danger Disabled
Custom bot accounts have been disabled temporarily due to Roblox changes. We plan to bring them back soon, stay tuned. For now, these instructions **will not work**.

## Getting your bot account cookie

:::tip

We recommend you make a dedicated Roblox account to use as your bot account.

## Adding your bot account to RoManager

**Open DMs with RoManager as you cannot run these commands in a server.**

Next, run this command:

<DiscordMessages>
	<DiscordMessage avatar="https://cdn.discordapp.com/embed/avatars/5.png">
		.bot-account add (your cookie here, including the warning part)
	</DiscordMessage>
	<DiscordMessage
		author="RoManager"
		verified={true}
		bot={true}
		avatar="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/738035113815834746/9c943bdaadc550fc4d7af38c6d2bc8ba.png"
	>
		<discord-reply
			slot="reply"
			avatar="https://cdn.discordapp.com/embed/avatars/5.png"
		>
			.bot-account add (your cookie here, including the warning part)
		</discord-reply>
		Successfully added bot account.
	</DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

## Using your bot account in a server

To link your bot account to a server, join the group you're going to set up if you haven't already, then run the `setup` command with the `--bot-account` flag, with the bot account username:

<DiscordMessages>
	<DiscordMessage avatar="https://cdn.discordapp.com/embed/avatars/5.png">
		.setup (group name or id) --bot-account (bot account username or id)
	</DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>
