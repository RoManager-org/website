## Adding the bot

To get started with RoManager, you first need to add the bot to a Discord server.

[Add to Discord](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=738035113815834746&permissions=8&scope=bot)

## Linking a Roblox group

Run the `.setup` command with your group's name, id, or url.

<DiscordMessages>
	<DiscordMessage>.setup your-group-name-or-id</DiscordMessage>
	<DiscordMessage
		author="RoManager"
		verified={true}
		bot={true}

:::info
Anyone with **Manage Server** permissions can run the `.setup` command, however only the group owner can link their group.
:::

## Giving the bot group permissions

To start, go to your group, and open the `Configure Group` page.

Next, open the `Members` tab.

Then, give the bot a role that has permissions already, or grant it permissions, as shown below.

:::info
We recommend giving the bot its own, standalone role.
:::

### Granting permissions to the bot's role

If the role you granted doesn't already have perms;

Open the `Roles` tab, click on the role you assigned the bot, and give it the necessary permissions, as shown in the embed after you ran the `setup` command.

Then click the **Save** button when done.

**You have now successfully set up RoManager! 🎉**
