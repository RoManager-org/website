## Using the API

All API methods are below, in the other categories. The API expects JSON data in the request body.

### Ratelimit

The ratelimit is 60 requests per 60 seconds. For example, you can send 60 requests in 5 seconds, however you will not be able to send any more requests for 55 seconds.

The following headers will be set so you know when you should retry your request:

| Header                  | Description                                                                                 |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Retry-After`           | time (in seconds) to wait until the next request can be sent, only present when ratelimited |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | request limit per minute                                                                    |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | number of requests left for the time window                                                 |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | amount of miliseconds before the requests left in the time window resets                    |
